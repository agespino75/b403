    "#### The for loop explained in simple terms\n",
    "This `for` loop is used to show responses piece by piece as they are received. Here's how it works in simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Getting Responses in Parts**: The loop receives pieces of a response from the system one at a time. In this example, the system is responding with information about the politician \"F.D. Roosevelt.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Printing Out Responses Immediately**: Each time a new piece of the response is received, it immediately prints it out. The setup makes sure there are no new lines between parts, so it all looks like one continuous response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No Waiting**: By using this loop, you don't have to wait for the entire response to be ready before you start seeing parts of it. This makes it feel quicker and more like a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the loop helps provide a smoother and more interactive way of displaying responses from the system as they are generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The for loop explained in technical terms\n",
    "This `for` loop is used to handle streaming output from a language model response. Here’s a breakdown of its functionality and context:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iteration through Streamed Output**: The `for` loop iterates over the generator returned by `chain.stream(...)`. The `stream` method of the `chain` object (which is a combination of a prompt template and a language model) is designed to yield responses incrementally. This is particularly useful when responses from a model are long or need to be displayed in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Fetching**: In this loop, `s` represents each piece of content that is streamed back from the model as the response is being generated. The model in this case is set up to respond with information about the politician \"F.D. Roosevelt\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Handling**: Inside the loop, `print(s.content, end=\"\", flush=True)` is called for each piece of streamed content. The `print` function is customized with:\n",
    "   - `end=\"\"`: This parameter ensures that each piece of content is printed without adding a new line after each one, thus allowing the response to appear continuous on a single line.\n",
    "   - `flush=True`: This parameter forces the output buffer to be flushed immediately after each print statement, ensuring that each piece of content is displayed to the user as soon as it is received without any delay.\n",

    "By using this loop, the code is able to display each segment of the model's response as it becomes available, making the user interface more dynamic and responsive, especially for real-time applications where prompt feedback is beneficial."
